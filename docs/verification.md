# Verification record

Verification was performed on **14 October 2026 (Asia/Seoul)** using an ARM64 Pixel 7 emulator running Android 15 (API 35). The app was built for Android 10 and later. No real user accounts or personal login credentials were used.

## Build and installation

- Gradle build and Android Lint completed with zero errors. Some dependency-update and layout recommendations remain as warnings.
- ARM64 and x86_64 test APKs were generated. They were signed with a local debug key and passed APK Signature Scheme v2 verification.
- `dev.air.browser` was successfully registered for Android's default browser role.
- The independent browser engine and authentication callbacks were checked with Chrome disabled in the emulator.

## Automated checks

**35 policy unit tests** covered URL parsing, deceptive domains, subdomains and ports, HTTPS upgrades, search domains, initial redirects, iframes, authentication-path manipulation, OAuth callback state, nested authentication, authentication expiry, and Firebase SDK event and callback formats.

**7 emulator integration tests** verified the following:

1. A search link shows a blocked page without starting an engine session.
2. Links within the site open, while links to another host do not send a request.
3. Script-driven attempts to navigate to another site are blocked.
4. A popup opens and closes, returning to its parent page.
5. An OAuth callback with the expected address and state is delivered to an installed test app.
6. Custom Tabs binding, session creation, warmup, and page-completion callbacks work.
7. A Firebase SDK callback activity pinned to the installed app's certificate receives the matching event and encrypted `link` field; a wrong event is blocked.

## Camera and screens

- The QR camera preview and torch button were checked after granting camera permission.
- A single QR code was supplied through the emulator's camera image input. The app decoded it through its camera path and opened `https://example.com/?source=air-qr`.
- Screenshots confirmed the QR-only home action and the web screen's read-only site information, back button, and finish button.
- Physical-device focus, low-light behavior, camera-permission changes, and manufacturer-specific background behavior still need testing.

## Not yet verified

Completed sign-ins using real Google, Kakao, Naver, banking, or other service accounts have not been tested. These checks cover the engine, browser protocols, navigation policy, and callbacks to other apps; they do not establish compatibility with every service. Custom SAML or native authentication flows, apps that specifically require Chrome, unfamiliar authentication or payment frames, and device-specific passkey behavior need testing with the actual apps and devices.

The Firebase adapter was implemented after inspecting the manifest and distributed class contracts in Google's [Firebase Auth Android SDK 25.0.0](https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/com/google/firebase/firebase-auth/25.0.0/firebase-auth-25.0.0.aar). The test receiver reproduces the activity and intent contract. It does not substitute for verification using the real Firebase SDK and server. The SDK was not added as an AIR app dependency.

Logs are stored under `artifacts/verification/`. The checksums in `artifacts/SHA256SUMS` identify the local APKs used for this verification.
